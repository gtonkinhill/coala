----------------

* Add option to calculate iHS in sumstat_ihh()
* Remove broken nSL statistic (`sumstat_nsl()`)


coala 0.1.1.9006
----------------

* Fix site frequency calculation when an outgroup is present (#96)


coala 0.1.1.9005
----------------

* Fix: Error in iHS calculation when all SNPs are removed.


coala 0.1.1.9004
----------------

* Fix: Remove SNPs that were not polymorphic in the given population before
  calculating EHH based statistics.


coala 0.1.1.9003
----------------

* Now writes seq-gen output into memory and not in files before it is parsed.
* Minor change: `get_outgroup` now returns `NA` if the model has no outgroup
  rather than throwing an error.


coala 0.1.1.9002
----------------

* Fixes buggy iHS calculation when `max_snps` and `position` was used
  simultaneously. The argument `max_snps` is now ignored if a position
  is given (#98).



coala 0.1.1.9001
----------------

* Adds optional support for parameter zero inflation for a deterministic
  fraction of loci instead of a random number. Can be used by setting
  `random = FALSE` in `par_zero_inflation` (#97).



coala 0.1.1.9000
----------------

* Adds the MCMF summary statistic (#94).
