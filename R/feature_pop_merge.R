#' Feature: Population Merge
#'
#' View backwards in time, this feature merges a population into another.
#' Forwards in time, this corresponds to a speciation event.
#'
#' Additionally, to the merge all migration rates from and the growth rate of
#' the source population will be set to 0 at the time of the merge to mimic
#' a speciation event forwards in time.
#'
#' @param pop_source The population from which all lines are moved.
#' @param pop_target The population to which the lines are moved.
#' @param time The time at which the merge occurs.
