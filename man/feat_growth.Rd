\title{Adds an exponential growth or decline of the size of one
population to a model.}
\usage{
feat_growth(rate, population, at.time = "0")
}
\arguments{
\item{rate}{A \code{\link{Parameter}} stating the rate of the change.}

\item{population}{The population which starts to grow or decline.}

\item{at.time}{The time at which the population starts to grow or decline.}
}
\value{
The demographic model with a size change.
}
\description{
This function changes the growth factor of a population at given
point in time ('at.time'). This factor than applies to the time
interval farther into the past from this point.
}
\details{
The population size changes by factor exp(-alpha*t), where alpha
is the growth parameter and t is the time since the growth has
started. Hence, for positive alpha, the population will 'decline
backwards in time' or grow forwards in time. Similar, will decline
in forwards time for a negative value of alpha.

If you want to add an instantaneous change of the population size,
then use the \link{model.addSizeChange} function.
}
\examples{
model <- coal_model(c(20,37), 88) +
  feat_growth(par_range('alpha', 0.1, 2), population=2, at.time="0")
