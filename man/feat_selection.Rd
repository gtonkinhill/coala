\title{Adds positive selection to a model}
\usage{
feat_selection(strength_AA = 0, strength_Aa = 0, strength_aa = 0,
  strength_A = NULL, population = "all", time, start = TRUE,
  start_frequency = 5e-04, Ne = 10000, position = 0.5,
  force_keep = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{strength_AA}{The selection strength for the selected homozygote}

\item{strength_Aa}{The selection strength for the heterozygote.}

\item{strength_aa}{The selection strength for the recessive homoygote.}

\item{strength_A}{This sets the strength for the selected allele in an
haploid model or a diploid model with additive selection.
\code{strength_AA}, \code{strength_Aa}, \code{strength_aa}
are ignored when this is argument is given.}

\item{population}{The population in which the allele is selected. Can either
be \code{all} for all population, or the number of a population.}

\item{time}{The time at which the selection starts.}

\item{start}{Whether selection should start at this time point. At this time
the selected allele is introduced in the population with an initial
starting frequency. This must be set to \code{TRUE} for exactly one
selection feature in the model. The values of \code{start_frequency},
\code{Ne}, \code{position} and \code{force_keep} are used for the model.
You can add aditional selection feature to the model to set the
selection strength for more demes or change it at different time points,
but these need to have \code{start = FALSE}.}

\item{start_frequency}{The start frequency at which the selected allele is
introduced at time \code{time}. If the model has multiple population, this
can either be a numeric vector that contains the initial frequency for each
population or a single number. In the latter case, the value is used for
all population specified with \code{populations}, and 0 is used for all
other populations.}

\item{Ne}{The effective population size that is used for the forward
simulations.}

\item{position}{The position of the selected site, relative to the
simulated sequence. Values between 0 and 1 are within the simulated area,
while smaller values are to the left of it and larger ones to the right.}

\item{force_keep}{Whether to restart simulatin in which the selected goes to
extinction or not.}

# Positive selection in population 2:
model <- coal_model(c(10, 13), 100) +
  feat_pop_merge(par_range('tau', .1, 2), 2, 1) +
  feat_selection(strength_AA=par_expr(2*s),
                 strength_Aa=par_range('s', 100, 2000),
                 population = 2,
                 time=par_expr(tau))
