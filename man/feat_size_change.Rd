\title{Feature: Instantaneous Size Change}
\usage{
feat_size_change(new_size, population = 1, time = "0")
}
\arguments{
\item{new_size}{A \code{\link{parameter}} giving the new size of the
population, as a fraction of N0.}

\item{population}{The number of the population whichs size changes.
Can also be set to "all". Then the size changes applies to all
populations.}

\item{time}{The time at which the population's size is changed.}
}
\value{
The feature, which can be added to a model using `+`.
}
\description{
This feature changes the effective population size of one
population. The change is performed at a given time point
and applies to the time interval further on into
the past from this point. The population size is set to a
fraction of N0.
}
\details{
If you want to add a continuous change over time,
use \link{feat_growth}.

\examples{
# A model with one smaller population:
model <- coal_model(c(20, 5), 3) +
  feat_size_change(.1, population = 2) +
  feat_mutation(1.0) +
  feat_migration(0.5, 2, 1) +
  sumstat_sfs()
simulate(model)

# A model of one population that experienced a bottleneck:
model <- coal_model(10, 1) +
  feat_size_change(0.1, time = 0.3) +
  feat_size_change(1.0, time = 0.5) +
  feat_mutation(20) +
  sumstat_sfs()
simulate(model)
