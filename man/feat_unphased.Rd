\title{Feature: Unphased}
\usage{
feat_unphased(ploidy, samples_per_ind = ploidy)
}
\arguments{
\item{ploidy}{The number of phased chromosomes that are simulated per
individual.}

\item{samples_per_ind}{The number of pseudo-chromosomes that are created
from the phased chromosomes for each indidivual.}
}
\value{
The feature, which can be added to a model using `+`.
}
\description{
This simulated unphased data by creating "pseudo-chromosomes". For these,
each position is randomly taken from a phased chromosome obtained by
simulation.
}
\details{
If this is used, the sample size is understood as the number of individuals.
For each individual, \code{poidy} chromosomes are simulated, and
\code{samples_per_ind} pseudo-chromosomes are created of these.
