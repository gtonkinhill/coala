\title{Feature: Unphased Sequences}
\usage{
feat_unphased(samples_per_ind)
}
\arguments{
\item{samples_per_ind}{The number of pseudo-chromosomes that are created
from the phased chromosomes for each individual.}
}
\value{
The feature, which can be added to a model using `+`.
}
\description{
This simulates unphased data by randomly mixing the sites within one
individual. Each position is randomly taken from a phased chromosome..
}
\details{
For each individual, \code{ploidy} chromosomes are simulated, and
\code{samples_per_ind} pseudo-chromosomes are created of these.
}
\examples{
# Simulate unphased data in a diploid population
model <- coal_model(10, 1, ploidy = 2) +
  feat_mutation(10) +
  feat_unphased(2) +
  sumstat_seg_sites()
simulate(model)

# The same as before, but return only one chromosome for
# each individual:
model <- coal_model(10, 1, ploidy = 2) +
  feat_mutation(10) +
  feat_unphased(1) +
  sumstat_seg_sites()
simulate(model)
}
