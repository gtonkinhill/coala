\title{A Summary Statistic based on the Four-Gamete-Condition}
\usage{
sumstat_four_gamete(name = "four_gamete", population = 1,
  transformation = identity)
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{The name of the summary statistic. When simulating a model,
the value of the statistics are written to an entry of the returned list
with this name. Summary statistic names must be unique in a model.}

\item{population}{The population for which the statistic is calculated.}

\item{transformation}{An optional function for transforming the results
of the statistic. If specified, the results of the transformation are
returned instead of the original values.}
}
\description{
The Four-Gamete-Condition for two SNPs is violated if all four combinations
of derived and ancestral alleles at the SNPs are observed in a gamete/a
haplotype. Under an Infinite-Sites mutation model, a violation indicates that
there must have been at least one recombination event between the SNPs.
This summary statistic calculates the percentage of certain pairs of SNPs
that violate the Four-Gamete-Condition.
It is sensitive for recombination and particularly useful when estimating
recombination rates.
}
\details{
The statistic generates a matrix where each row represents one locus, and the
columns give the statistic for different classes of pairs of SNPs:

\describe{
\item{mid_near}{The value for all pairs of SNPs that are close together, that
  is within 10 percent of the locus" length. If locus trios are used, only pairs of
  SNPs were both SNPs are on the middle locus are considered.}
\item{mid_far}{Same as \code{mid_near}, but for pairs of SNPs that are
  more that 10 percent of the locus" length apart. }
\item{outer}{Only when using locus trios. The statistic for pairs
  where both SNPs are on the same outer locus.}
\item{between}{Only when using locus trios. The statistic for pairs
  where one SNPs is on the middle locus, and the other is on an outer one.}
\item{mid}{The value for all pairs on the
  middle locus or all pairs when not using trios.}
\item{perc_polym}{The percentage of positions that are polymorpic.}
}
