\usage{
sumstat_ihh(name = "ihh", position = NA, population = 1,
  max_snps = 1000, calc_ihs = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{The name of the summary statistic. When simulating a model,
the value of the statistics are written to an entry of the returned list
with this name. Summary statistic names must be unique in a model.}

\item{position}{A position relative to the locus extent, e.g. 0.5 for the
middle of the locus. If provided, the statistic will be calculate
for the SNP closest to the given position.
Otherwise, it will be calculated for all SNPs.
The position is relative to the middle locus" extend if trios
are used.}

\item{population}{The population for which the statistic is calculated.}

\item{max_snps}{The maximal number of SNPs per locus that are used for the
calculation. If a locus has more SNPs than this number, only a
random subset will be used for calculating iHS to increase performance.
Set to \code{Inf} to use all SNPs.}

\item{calc_ihs}{If set to \code{TRUE}, additionally standardized iHS is
calculated.}
}
\value{
When added to a model, the statistic returns a matrix for each locus.
  The columns contain the abosulute position of the SNP
  (POSITION) and the values for integrated EHH for the
  ancestral allele (IHHa), integrated EHH for the derived allele (IHHd),
  integrated EHHS (IES) and iHS (only if \code{calc_ihs = TRUE}),
  either for all SNPs when no position is given or
  for the SNP nearest to the selected position. Each SNP is represented by
  a row, sorted by position on the locus.

Coala relies on \code{\link[rehh]{scan_hh}} from package \pkg{rehh} to
calculate this statistic. Please refer
to their documentation for detailed information on the implementation.
