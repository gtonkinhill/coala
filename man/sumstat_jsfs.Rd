\usage{
sumstat_jsfs(name = "jsfs", populations = c(1, 2), per_locus = FALSE,
  transformation = identity)
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{The name of the summary statistic. When simulating a model,
the value of the statistics are written to an entry of the returned list
with this name. Summary statistic names must be unique in a model.}

\item{populations}{The populations for which the statistic is calculated.}

\item{per_locus}{If \code{TRUE}, the JSFS is return for each locus instead
of globally. In this case, the result is a list, where each entry is the
JSFS for the corresponding locus.}

\item{transformation}{An optional function for transforming the results
of the statistic. If specified, the results of the transformation are
returned instead of the original values.}
