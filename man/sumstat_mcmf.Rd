\title{Summary Statistic: Most Common Mutation's Frequency}
\usage{
sumstat_mcmf(name = "mcmf", population = 1, transformation = identity)
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{The name of the summary statistic. When simulating a model,
the value of the statistics are written to an entry of the returned list
with this name. Summary statistic names must be unique in a model.}

\item{population}{The population for which the statistic is calculated.
Can also be "all" to calculate it from all populations.}

\item{transformation}{An optional function for transforming the results
of the statistic. If specified, the results of the transformation are
returned instead of the original values.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector containing MCMF for each locus.
}
\description{
This summary statistic calculates the observed frequency
of the mutational pattern that is observed most often in
the data.
}
\examples{
# Calculate MCMF for a panmictic population
model <- coal_model(10, 2) +
  feat_mutation(50) +
  sumstat_mcmf()
simulate(model)
