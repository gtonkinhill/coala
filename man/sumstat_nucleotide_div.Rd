\title{Calculates the Nucleodite Diversity Pi}
\usage{
sumstat_nucleotide_div(name = "pi", population = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{The name of the summary statistic. When simulating a model,
the value of the statistics are written to an entry of the returned list
with this name. Summary statistic names must be unique in a model.}

\item{population}{The population for which the statistic is calculated.}
}
\value{
On simulation, this returns a vector with the value of pi for
  each locus.
}
\description{
This calculates the nucleotide diversity / mean pairwise difference usually
for a population.
}
\details{
The statistic is usually denoted by pi and can be used
as an estimator for the per locus scaled muation rate theta.
